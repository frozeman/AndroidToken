AndroidToken Commodity

Proof of Work/Proof of Stake Hybrid

Scrypt

Linear Difficulty Retarget (2 block retarget)

Transactions require 6 confirmations

Block reward halves after every ~50000 blocks:

Blocks 1-55000 = 10 ADT per; 
Blocks 55001-95000 = 5 ADT per;
Blocks 95001-145000 = 2.5 ADT per;
Blocks 145001-195000 = 1.25 ADT per
etc

First year coin mint of ~1000000

Aiming to be PoS-only blockchain once PoW block subsidy reaches baseline reward of 0.01.
Much research will go into maintaining security of the blockchain if/when ADT goes PoS only.  Many possible schemes and solutions are being analyzed for potential implementation, including but not limited to:

-CoinJoin revision for additional PoS overlay scheme

-Increasing PoS rewards to slightly accelerate coin cap growth, to make it more difficult for 51% stake attack.

-Revision to current PoS trust score algorithm

-Additional randomized trust score scheme to increase scrutiny for randomly selected new PoS blocks

Default P2P Port: 2454

replace username and password with your own username and password.  Do not use the same username/password that is the same as something sensitive, like a website.  

Place the file in your data directory. (you need to run the Qt or daemon once before you do this)

If using Linux, the data directory is located at /home/User/.AndroidToken 
where User is your login username for your system.

If using Windows, the data directory is located at C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\AndroidToken where USERNAME is replaced with your Windows Username.
